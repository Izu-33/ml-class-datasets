# 📊 Machine Learning Course Datasets

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Course Datasets Repository**!  
This repository contains curated datasets that my students and I will use throughout our AI/ML training sessions. The datasets are selected to cover a wide range of machine learning tasks — from regression and classification to natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV).

The goal of this repository is to provide a **one-stop collection of practical datasets** that can be used for teaching, learning, and building portfolio projects.

- Each dataset is stored in its own folder inside the `datasets/` directory.
- Some datasets are linked directly from Kaggle and can be downloaded using the provided links.
- More datasets may be added over time, and some may be removed if outdated.
